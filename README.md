Project Overview

This is a simple Virtual Reality (VR) project developed using Unity to demonstrate the basics of VR application development. The project focuses on creating an immersive 3D environment where users can explore and interact using a VR headset and controllers.

Technologies Used

Game Engine: Unity

Programming Language: C#

VR SDK: Unity XR / OpenXR

Platform: PC-based VR

Features

Immersive 3D virtual environment

Smooth player movement and navigation

Basic object interaction using VR controllers

Realistic lighting and environment setup

Comfortable user experience with optimized performance

Project Details

The project includes scene creation, camera rig setup, and VR player controls using Unity’s XR framework. Objects in the scene respond to user input, allowing interaction such as grabbing or selecting items. Proper lighting and environment design are used to enhance realism and depth perception.

Learning Outcomes

Understanding VR concepts and workflows in Unity

Hands-on experience with XR camera and controllers

Basics of 3D interaction and spatial awareness

Introduction to immersive application design
